                        GeOMe has developed a web-based database to aid collaboration and the cross-dissemination
                        of published data. Although Genbank is an important repository of sequence data, it does not
                        require the uploading of important metadata associated with individual genotypes such as
                        precise sampling locations and there is no central repository nor set standards for such
                        population genetic data and associated metadata. The GeOMe database is designed to fill this
                        gap.

                    <li>In the process of uploading the metadata for your next-generation sequence data we create two

                    </li>
                    <ol>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Generate a FIMS template (under “tools” tab) for your metadata
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This option allows the user to create an excel file to store the metadata associated
                        with each of their samples.
