This code drives the [GeOMe database](http://geome-db.org/).

The GeOMe database validates field data and tracks physical samples and collecting events, using globally unique and persistent identifiers, for reference in collections management systems, laboratory information management systems, seqence repositories, and publications.

The GEOME database is built using Gradle scripts (contained in this repository) and running on Jetty Server that stores data in a postgres database.
